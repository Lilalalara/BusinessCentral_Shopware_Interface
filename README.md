# BusinessCentral and Shopware Interface

I made this project in preparation for a synchronization project at work. The program can get data from Business Central and put it into Shopware.

I get different objects from Business Central and create them accordingly in Shopware:
- Tax information
- Category information
- Currency information
- Attribute information
- Product information


They are created in the specifed saleschannel and automatically visible in the Frontend.
